# Notes for maintainers:
# - This workflow pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). It uses the built-in
#   GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate — no extra repository secrets are required for pushing
#   to GHCR as long as `packages: write` permission is granted (already set above).
# - The workflow dynamically finds the jar produced under target/ and passes it to the Docker
#   build via build-arg JAR_FILE (which matches the ARG in your Dockerfile.dockerfile).
# - By default images pushed to GHCR may be private. To allow others to pull, you can make
#   the package public in GitHub Packages settings or grant read access to specific repositories.
# - If you prefer image names under a different owner/org, adjust the tag to the desired owner.
